# Webex Recording Download Bot

Webex meeting recordings are normally available for download only to meeting hosts and only using a web browser. Host needs to access the webex site's web page and find the recordings there. This Bot provides a capability to download recordings from a Webex meeting (both Classic and Space meetings) by just sending it a meeting number and host email or by forwarding it a Space recording message.

The links for download are temporary links (valid for 4 hours) provided by Webex [Meetings](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/meetings) and [Recordings](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/recordings) APIs. The Bot does not download the recordings and does not store any meeting or recording information.
